# Image composition with pre-trained diffusion models

This repository contains code accompanying the post Image composition with pre-trained diffusion models. <br>
The code is a minimal modification of the Stable Diffusion pipeline in the [diffusers library](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers) by Hugging Face to implement ideas from [MultiDiffusion: Fusing Diffusion Paths for Controlled Image Generation
](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08113). You can look at the [Colab Nootebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1MzzGN5FJNqlJESuO5FigYC8eoOfwzplO?usp=sharing) for usage. <br>
If you use the default Stable Diffusion model specified in the code, please check the [model card](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-base) for the license and Use Restrictions.
